## Map Generation

This project includes a simple `MapGenerator` script found in `Assets/Scripts`.
It uses Unity's **Grid** and **Tilemap** systems to build a tile-based map at
runtime. The generator fills the ground layer with tiles and randomly places
trees. Each cell's passability is stored in a `bool[,]` array, accessible via
`IsPassable(x, y)`.

### Usage
1. Create a parent GameObject with a `Grid` component.
2. Add two child objects, each with `Tilemap` and `TilemapRenderer` components â€“
   one for ground and another for trees.
3. Attach `MapGenerator` to the parent and assign the Tilemaps and tile assets in
   the Inspector.
4. Configure map size and tree probability, then run the scene to generate
   the map.

## Colonist

The `Colonist` prefab is driven by the `Colonist` script found in `Assets/Scripts/Colonists`.
It requests tasks from a `TaskManager` in the scene and moves using a simple A* search over the map generated by `MapGenerator`.
Tasks are represented by the `Task` class and queued through `TaskManager`.

### Example
Two colonists are created automatically when the scene starts. If no tasks are available they will wander the map.
1. Add a `TaskManager` component to an empty GameObject in the scene (this is also done automatically by `ColonistBootstrap`).
2. Create a new GameObject and attach the `Colonist` script if you want additional colonists.
3. At runtime use `TaskManager.AddTask(new Task(targetPosition))` to send a colonist somewhere.

## Tree Chopping

A simple chopping tool is available via the `TreeChopController` script. When the game starts a button labeled **Chop Trees** is created on the UI. Toggle the button and click on any tree tile to designate it for chopping. Free colonists will automatically receive tasks to move to the tree and remove it.
